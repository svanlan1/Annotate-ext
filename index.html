			<h2>What is Marker?</h2>
			<p class="instruction">
				Marker is a Google Chrome extension developed to help expedite making annotations on designs for web accessibility.
			</p>
			<h2>Why was Marker created?</h2>
			<p class="instruction">
				After spending far too much time making annotations on designs and developed pages, writing the same text over and over and over and over again, I decided to create this extension to make this process easy, painless, consistent, and accurate. <br />
				Using Marker ensures that the latest guidelines are followed and allows the user to quickly create documents to hand off to developers.
			</p>
			<h2>How does Marker work?</h2>
			<p class="instruction">
				With Marker, you are able to place pins on the page, highlight elements, and make annotations directly on the page.
			</p>
			<h2>Who should use Marker?</h2>
			<p class="instruction">
				Marker can be used by anyone!  Designers, developers, business analysts, or even less technically saavy users (e.g., I want someone to build me a website, but I want to make sure that it's accessible).
			</p>
			<h2>What types of pages does Marker work on?</h2>
			<p class="instruction">
				If you can load it in the browser, you can annotate it!
			</p>
			<h2>What am I supposed to do with the annotations?</h2>
			<p class="instruction">
				Once you've finished drawing your annotations on the page, you will be presented with a modal window that gives you accessibility recommendations.
			</p>
			<h2>What does Marker conform to?</h2>
			<p class="instruction">
				Marker uses WCAG 2.0 Level AAA recommendations.
			</p>
			<h2>Why doesn't Marker conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA?</h2>
			<p class="instruction">
				You can choose what to include or not include.  Marker simply gives you the <strong>ALL</strong> of the guidelines that have been outlined by W3.  If you only need WCAG 2.0 Level AA recommendations, you can choose to not add WCAG 2.0 Level AAA.
			</p>
			<h2>What do I do when I'm finished making recommendations?</h2>
			<p class="instruction">
				When you've completed your annotations, click the 'Export' button and a Microsoft Word document will be exported.  The document follows the WCAG Methodology template
